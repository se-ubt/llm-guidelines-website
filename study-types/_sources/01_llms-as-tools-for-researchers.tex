\subsection{LLMs as Tools for Software Engineering Researchers}

LLMs can be leveraged as powerful tools to assist researchers conducting empirical studies.
They can automate various tasks such as data collection, preprocessing, and analysis.
For example, LLMs can apply pre-defined coding guides to large qualitative datasets (\textbf{annotation}), assess the quality of software artifacts (\textbf{rating}), generate summaries of research papers (\textbf{synthesis}), and even simulate human behavior in empirical studies (\textbf{subject}).
This can significantly reduce the time and effort required by researchers, allowing them to focus on more complex aspects of their studies.
However, all these applications also come with limitations, potential threats to validity, and implications for the reproducibility of study results.
In our guidelines, the following study types and used to contextualize the recommendations we provide.


\subsubsection{LLMs as Annotators}

\emph{Description:} LLMs can serve as annotators by automatically labeling artifacts with corresponding categories for data analysis based on a pre-defined coding guide.
In qualitative data analysis, manually annotating or coding text passages, e.g. in software artifacts, open-ended survey responses, or interview transcripts, is often a time-consuming manual process~\cite{DBLP:journals/ase/BanoHZT24}.
LLMs can be used to augment or even replace human annotations, provide suggestions for new codes (see \textbf{synthesis}), or even automate the entire process.

\emph{Examples:} Recent work in software engineering has begun exploring the use of LLMs for annotation tasks.
Huang et al.~\cite{Huang2023Enhancing} proposed an approach leveraging multiple LLMs for joint annotation of mobile application reviews. 
They used three 7B-parameter models (Llama3, Gemma, and Mistral) with an absolute majority voting rule (i.e., a label is only accepted if it receives more than half of the total votes from the models). 
Accordingly, the annotations fell into three categories: exact matches (where all models agreed), partial matches (where a majority agreed), and non-matches (where no majority was reached).
Training on their MJAR dataset improved classifier performance. BERT achieved higher F1 (78.62%) and accuracy (80.36%) than when trained on single-model annotations (Mistral: 72.56%, Gemma: 75.84%, Llama3: 77.48%). RoBERTa also saw a 1.73% F1 increase with MJAR, highlighting the benefits of multi-model annotation.

\emph{Advantages:} Recent research demonstrates several key advantages of using LLMs as annotators, in particular their cost-effectiveness as well as efficiency and accurancy benefits.
LLM-based annotation dramatically reduces costs compared to human labeling, with studies showing cost reductions of 50-96\% across various natural language tasks~\cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/WangLXZZ21}. A comprehensive validation study across 27 diverse annotation tasks demonstrated that processing large datasets (>200,000 samples) can be achieved at relatively low cost~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2306-00176}. This cost advantage has been quantified in~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/HeHDRH24}, with GPT-4 annotation costing only \$122.08 compared to \$4,508 for a comparable MTurk pipeline, while also completing the task in just 2 days versus several weeks for the crowdsourced approach.
Moreover, LLMs consistently demonstrate strong performance, with ChatGPT's accuracy exceeding crowd workers by approximately 25\% on average~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-15056} and achieving impressive results in specific tasks such as sentiment analysis (64.9\% accuracy) and counterspeech detection (0.791 precision)~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-10145}. They also show remarkably high intercoder agreement, surpassing both crowd workers and trained annotators~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2303-15056}. Recent research further validates this superior performance, demonstrating GPT-4 achieving 83.6\% accuracy in academic text annotation tasks, outperforming well-executed crowdsourcing pipelines that peaked at 81.5\% accuracy~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/HeHDRH24}. Notably, models trained on LLM-generated labels can sometimes outperform the LLM itself~\cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/WangLXZZ21}.

\emph{Challenges:} Several important challenges and limitations must also be considered, which include reliability issues, human-LLM interaction challenges, biases, errors, and resource considerabtions.
Studies suggest that while LLMs show promise as annotation tools in SE, their optimal use may be in augmenting rather than replacing human annotators entirely~\cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/WangLXZZ21, DBLP:conf/chi/HeHDRH24}, with careful consideration given to verification mechanisms and confidence thresholds
LLMs can negatively impact human judgment when their labels are incorrect~\cite{DBLP:conf/www/HuangKA23a}, and their overconfidence requires careful verification~\cite{DBLP:conf/kdd/WanSJKCNSSWYABJ24}. The quality of LLM-generated explanations significantly impacts human annotators' performance and satisfaction~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/Wang0RMM24}.
Moreover, LLMs show significant variability in annotation quality across different tasks~\cite{DBLP:conf/www/HuangKA23a,DBLP:conf/chi/Wang0RMM24}, with particular challenges in complex tasks and post-training events. They are especially unreliable for high-stakes labeling tasks~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/Wang0RMM24}, demonstrating notable performance disparities across different label categories~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-10145}. Recent empirical evidence indicates that LLM consistency in text annotation often falls below scientific reliability thresholds, with outputs being sensitive to minor prompt variations~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-11085}. Specific challenges have been identified with context-dependent annotations, where LLMs show particular difficulty in correctly interpreting text segments that require broader contextual understanding~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/HeHDRH24}. This variability has been further validated in large-scale studies, where even within the same dataset, annotation performance can vary substantially between different classification tasks~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2306-00176}. While pooling multiple outputs can improve reliability, this approach necessitates additional computational resources and still requires validation against human-annotated data.
While generally cost-effective, LLM annotation requires careful management of per-token charges, particularly for longer texts~\cite{DBLP:conf/emnlp/WangLXZZ21}. Furthermore, achieving reliable annotations may require multiple runs of the same input to enable majority voting, which can significantly increase computational costs and partially offset the cost advantages over human annotation~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-11085}. However, He et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/HeHDRH24} challenge this concern, demonstrating that GPT-4's total annotation costs remained less than 3\% of equivalent crowdsourcing expenses while achieving superior accuracy.
Finally, research has identified consistent biases in label assignment, including tendencies to overestimate certain labels and misclassify neutral content, particularly in stance detection tasks~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2304-10145}. These biases are especially pronounced when dealing with newer topics, such as the Russo-Ukrainian conflict sentiment analysis.


\subsubsection{LLMs as Raters}

\emph{Description:} In empirical studies, LLMs can act as raters to evaluate the quality or other properties of software artifacts such as code, documentation, and design patterns.

\emph{Example:}  For instance, LLMs can be trained to assess code readability, adherence to coding standards, or the quality of comments. 

\emph{Promises:} By providing---depending on the model configuration---consistent and relatively ``objective'' evaluations, LLMs can help mitigate certain biases and part of the variability that human raters might introduce. 
This can lead to more reliable and reproducible results in empirical studies.

\emph{Perils:} However, when relying on the judgment of LLMs, researchers have to make sure to build a reliable process for generating ratings that considers the non-deterministic nature of LLMs and report the intricacies of that process transparently.

\emph{Previous Work in SE:}  \textbf{TODO:} Examples of such studies in software engineering include...


\subsubsection{LLMs for Synthesis}

\emph{Description:} LLMs can be used to synthesis large amounts of qualitative data.

\emph{Example:}  For example, they can summarize or compare papers for literature reviews or support researchers in deriving codes and developing coding guides during the initial phase of qualitative data analysis. Those code can then later be used to annotate more data (see \textbf{annotation}).

\subsubsection{LLMs as Subjects}

\emph{Description:} LLMs can be used as subjects in empirical studies to simulate human behavior and interactions. In this role, LLMs generate responses that mimic human participants, making them particularly useful for studies involving user interactions, collaborative coding environments, or software usability assessments. 
To achieve this, prompt engineering techniques are widely employed, with a common approach being the use of the \textit{Personas Pattern}~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2308-07702}, which involves tailoring LLM responses to align with predefined profiles or roles that emulate specific user archetypes. 
Furthermore, recent sociological studies have emphasized that, to be effectively utilized in this capacity, LLMsâ€”including their agentic versions tailored through prompt engineeringâ€”should meet four criteria of algorithmic fidelity~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2209-06899}; generated responses should be: indistinguishable from human-produced texts; consistent with the attitudes and sociodemographic information of the conditioning context; naturally aligned with the form, tone, and content of the provided context; and reflective of patterns in relationships between ideas, demographics, and behavior observed in comparable human data.

\emph{Example:} LLMs can be used as subjects in various types of empirical studies, enabling researchers to simulate human participants in controlled, repeatable scenarios. 
Examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Survey and Interview Studies:} LLMs can impersonate developers responding to survey questionnaires or interviews, allowing researchers to test the clarity and effectiveness of survey items or to simulate responses under varying conditions, such as different expertise levels or cultural contexts.
    \item \textbf{Usability Studies:} In software usability studies, LLMs can simulate end-user feedback, providing insights into potential usability issues and offering suggestions for improvement based on predefined user personas.
    \item \textbf{Experimental Studies:} LLMs can participate in experiments that test collaborative coding practices, such as pair programming or code review scenarios, by simulating developers with distinct coding styles, expertise levels, or attitudes.
    \item \textbf{Simulated Decision-Making Studies:} LLMs can emulate team members in simulated decision-making exercises, such as planning sprints or prioritizing software requirements, enabling researchers to analyze team dynamics under different configurations.
\end{itemize}
Although not specifically focused on software engineering, Xu et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/ipm/XuSRGPLSH24} have compiled various uses within the field of social science that are particularly relevant and transferable to the context of software development, given its socio-technical nature.

\emph{Promises:} Using LLMs as subjects offers valuable insights while significantly reducing the need to recruit human participants, a process that is often time-consuming and costly~\cite{DBLP:conf/vl/Madampe0HO24}. 
Furthermore, employing LLMs as subjects enables researchers to conduct empirical research under consistent and repeatable conditions, enhancing the reliability and scalability of the studies.

\emph{Perils:} However, it is important that researchers are aware of LLMs' inherent biases~\cite{Crowell2023} and limitations~\cite{DBLP:journals/ais/HardingDLL24, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2402-01908} when using them as study subjects; examples of these include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Distorted Representation:} LLMs tend to misrepresent demographic group perspectives, reflecting more the opinions of out-group members than those of in-group members.
    \item \textbf{Group Flattening:} LLMs often oversimplify demographic identities, failing to capture the diversity of opinions and experiences within a group.
    \item \textbf{Essentialization of Identity:} The use of identity-based prompts can reduce identities to fixed and innate characteristics, amplifying perceived differences between groups.
\end{itemize}
To mitigate these issues, encoded identity names can be used instead of explicit labels, the temperature setting can be increased to enhance response diversity, and alternatives to demographic prompts can be employed when the goal is to broaden response coverage~\cite{DBLP:journals/ais/HardingDLL24, DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2402-01908}.

\emph{Previous Work in SE:} The use of LLMs as subjects is not yet widely adopted in software engineering, although much of what is being explored in the field of social science is beginning to be transferred.

Examples of studies in software engineering include the works of Gerosa et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/ase/GerosaTSS24} and Bano et al.~\cite{bano2025doessoftwareengineerlook}. 
Gerosa et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/ase/GerosaTSS24} explored various applications of LLMs, such as persona-based interviews, multi-persona focus groups, survey simulations, and observational studies employing multimodal models. They examined how LLMs can emulate human responses and behaviors while addressing critical ethical concerns, biases, and methodological challenges. The authors advocated for a hybrid approach that integrates AI-generated and human-generated data to improve research scalability and effectiveness while ensuring that human subjects are not entirely replaced.
Bano et al.~\cite{bano2025doessoftwareengineerlook} investigated how LLMs, specifically GPT-4 and Microsoft Copilot, reinforce societal stereotypes in software engineering recruitment processes. They generated 300 candidate profiles and evaluated LLMs' ability to rank candidates for four distinct SE roles. Both textual and visual outputs were analyzed, uncovering biases favoring male, Caucasian candidates, lighter skin tones, and slim physiques, particularly in senior positions. Their findings underline the risks of perpetuating exclusionary norms and present a replicable framework for assessing biases in LLM-generated data, emphasizing the need for equitable and inclusive AI integration in software engineering workflows.
