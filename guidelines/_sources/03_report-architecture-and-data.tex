\subsection{Report Tool Architecture and Supplemental Data}

\subsubsection{Context}

Oftentimes, there is a complex layer around the LLM that preprocesses data, prepares prompts, or filters user requests.
One example is ChatGPT, which can, among others, use the GPT-4o model.
GitHub Copilot uses the same model as well, and researchers can build their own tools utilizing GPT-4o directly (e.g., via the OpenAI API).
The infrastructure around the bare model can significantly contribute to the performance of a model in a certain task.
Therefore, it is crucial that researchers clearly describe what the LLM contributes to the tool or method presented in a research paper.

\textbf{TODO:} Architecture (e.g., usage of RAG, agent-based architecture, etc.)

\textbf{TODO:} data dump of vector database if used

\textbf{TODO:} finetuning? if yes, how? also: publish data used for finetuning (if not confidential)

\subsubsection{Recommendations}

\textbf{TODO:} Connect guideline to study types and for each type have bullet point lists with information that MUST, SHOULD, or MAY be reported (usage of those terms according to RFC 2119~\cite{rfc2119}).
