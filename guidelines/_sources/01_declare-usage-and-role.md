## Declare LLM Usage and Role

When conducting any kind of empirical study involving LLMs, it is essential to clearly declare that an LLM was used. This includes specifying the purpose of using the LLM in the study, the tasks it was applied to, and the expected outcomes. Transparency in the usage of LLMs helps in understanding the context and scope of the study, facilitating better interpretation and comparison of results.
Beyond this declaration, we recommend authors to be explicit about the LLM's exact role (see also the [architecture guideline](#report-tool-architecture-and-supplemental-data)).

### Recommendations per Study Type

**TODO:** Connect guideline to study types and for each type have bullet point lists with information that MUST, SHOULD, or MAY be reported (usage of those terms according to [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119)).
